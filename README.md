# Ecommerce-DataWarehouse-SQL-Python

This project is a mini e-commerce data warehouse system developed as part of the final project for the SQL Master course. It combines SQL, Python scripting, and a simple UI interface to simulate a full-stack data solution for retail order management and analytics.

## Features

- SQL schema for customer, seller, and order management 
- Python backend for data handling and automation
- PyQt-based UI for customer and manager interaction
- Organized folder structure for easy navigation

## Technologies Used

- SQL (MySQL)
- Python 3.x
- PyQt5 (for UI)
- VSCode for development
- Git & GitHub for version control

## How It Works

- SQL files build the database schema and structure.
- Python scripts handle application logic and data manipulation.
- The UI layer allows interaction with different roles (customer, seller, manager).
